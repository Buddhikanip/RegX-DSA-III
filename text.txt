So in our project, we hope to develop a web-based application and two mobile applications to let JOM aid with their company procedure easily as well as efficiently, So different stakeholders like Managers, Collectors, Distributors, and Suppliers will have separate interfaces to fulfill their assigned work and other related needs. And there will be a separate external administrator for this system who is not a part of the management hierarchy. In addition, wholesale raw material suppliers also can access this website and register. Then they will be able to provide the company with coconut count details so the company can collect accordingly. Simply, this web application supports JOM  in supplier, inventory and distribution management.
